**Abstract from the paper:**
Using generative models for Inverse Graphics is an active area of research. However, most works focus on developing models for supervised and semi-supervised methods. In this work, we study the problem of unsupervised learning of 3D geometry from single images. Our approach is to use a generative model that produces 2-D images as projections of a latent 3D voxel grid, which we train either as a variational auto-encoder or using adversarial methods. This post looks into how we can recover 3D shape and pose from general datasets such as MNIST, and MNIST Fashion in good quality, basen on the paper, "CITE", and exhibits some of the results obtained during training to be complementary to the paper. You can find the more details in the paper.

**Learning 3D shapes from MNIST and MNIST Fashion during training:**

Figure-1 shows how 3D shapes are learned during training while Figure-2 lists renderings of these 3D shapes. It should be noted that only MNIST and MNIST Fashion items are shown although the model is trained on a dataset consisting of a mixture of MNIST, MNIST Fashion, CelebA, and some categories of ModelNet40. That's why we see human faces in rendered images in the initial part of the training.

**Conclusion:**
This paper shows possible ways to learn 3D geometry from single images, and  showcases its results using MNIST, MNIST Fashion, and CelebA datasets, in each of which there is a single view for each object. For more details, you can read the paper here: (CITE)
